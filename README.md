More details :
this project was created using :
reactJS library
react-router-dom v6
react-redux & reduxJs/toolkit
react-bootstrap, bootstrap & bootstrap-icons for ui construction.

this was a good practise to 
react, redux/toolkit, react-router-dom v6 
and last but not least learning react-bootStrap that was a real life savior in ui construction.
